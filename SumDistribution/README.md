A program that takes an integer command-line argument 'm', followed by a sequence of positive integer command-line arguments a_1, a_2, ... a_n, and prints m random indices, choosing each index 'i' with probablility proportional to a_i.
This program takes an integer command-line argument 'm'. Following the first argument, it takes n integer values through the command-line, and calculates their sum. It then prints 'm' random values, with an index 'i' that has probability proportional to a<sub>i</sub>.
